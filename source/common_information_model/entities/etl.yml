description: Event fields used to define specific metadata about the event during
  the processing of an ETL pipeline.
data_fields:
- standard_name: etl_format_applied
  type: string
  description: Formatting or encoding applied during the ETL processing. Also referred
    to as CODEC in some use cases. Can be an array if multiple formats were applied/determined
  sample_value: '[ "sylog", "json" ]'
- standard_name: etl_format_is_cef
  type: boolean
  description: During ETL processing, event is determined to be CEF (format)
  sample_value: 'false'
- standard_name: etl_format_is_json
  type: boolean
  description: During ETL processing, event is determined to be JSON (format)
  sample_value: 'true'
- standard_name: etl_format_is_syslog
  type: boolean
  description: 'During ETL processing, event is determined to be Syslog (format).
    Technically you could send data encoded in different format over syslog (ie: CEF
    or JSON), therefore an event/log can have this tag/field as well as other format
    fields'
  sample_value: 'true'
- standard_name: etl_format_is_xml
  type: boolean
  description: During ETL processing, event is determined to be XML (format)
  sample_value: 'true'

  description: 'Application name used to receive or gather the log for the very first
    portion of the ETL processing (ex: kafka, beats, syslog)'

- standard_name: etl_input_application_protocol
  type: string
  description: 'Application protocol used to receive or gather the log for the very
    first portion of the ETL processing (ex: syslog, http, sftp)'
  sample_value: kafka
- standard_name: etl_input_port
  type: integer
  description: Port (network) used to receive or gather the log for the very first
    portion of the ETL processing
  sample_value: '9092'
- standard_name: etl_input_protocol
  type: string
  description: 'Protocol (network) used to receive or gather the log for the very
    first portion of the ETL processing (ie: tcp, udp, icmp)'
