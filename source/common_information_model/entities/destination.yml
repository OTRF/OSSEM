description: Event fields used to define the destination (server) in a network connection
  event.
data_fields:
- standard_name: dst_bytes
  type: integer
  description: network bytes sent by the dst_ip_addr
  sample_value: '100'
- standard_name: dst_domain
  type: string
  description: If there is a clear distinction of the domain VS hostname VS FQDN this
    is the domain field. More often than not this should NOT be used and should be
    defined in the ./target.md, ./host.md, or ./user.md. However, you may follow the
    recommendations additional-guidelines/domain_or_hostname_or_fqdn.md if there is
    a clear example for this
  sample_value: bigwheel.corporation.local
- standard_name: dst_file_extension
  type: string
  description: The file extension of a file (.txt, .exe, etc)
  sample_value: exe

  description: full path of a file including the name of the file
  sample_value: C:\users\wardog\z.exe
- standard_name: dst_fqdn
  type: string
  description: If there is a clear distinction of the domain VS hostname VS FQDN this
    is the FQDN field. More often than not this should NOT be used and should be defined
    in the ./target.md, ./host.md, or ./user.md. However, you may follow the recommendations
    additional-guidelines/domain_or_hostname_or_fqdn.md if there is a clear example
    for this
  sample_value: bob-berto-pc.bigwheel.corporation.local
- standard_name: dst_host_name
  type: string
  description: The destination server, host, hostname, domain, or domain name. Some
    examples, would include the TLS server name, HTTP Host, DNS Query Name, etc. For
    information on how to define and use this field refer to the documentation additional-guidelines/domain_or_hostname_or_fqdn.md
  sample_value: www.google.com
- standard_name: dst_ip_addr
  type: ip
  description: Destination IP address
  sample_value: 8.8.8.8
- standard_name: dst_ip_bytes
  type: integer
  description: network IP (header) bytes sent by the dst_ip_addr
  sample_value: '104'
- standard_name: dst_is_ipv6
  type: boolean
  description: If dst_ip_addr is IP version 6
  sample_value: 'false'
- standard_name: dst_mac
  type: string
  description: Destination MAC address
  sample_value: a9:68:82:28:c4:6d
- standard_name: dst_mime_type
  type: string
  description: Destination MIME type as seen in (layer 7) application layer details

  description: Destination port number
  sample_value: '138'
- standard_name: dst_port_name
  type: string
  description: Destination port name. This is usually determined by IANA common port

  sample_value: netbios-dgm
- standard_name: dst_vlan_id
  type: integer
  description: The destination VLAN ID if it can be determined. Most commonly if from
