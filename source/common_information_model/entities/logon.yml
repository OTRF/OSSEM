title: Logon Schema
description: Event fields used to define metadata about logon events.
data_fields:
- standard_name: user_logon_id
  type: integer
  description: hexadecimal value that can help you correlate this event with recent
    events that might contain the same Logon ID
  sample_value: '0x8dcdc'
- standard_name: logon_type
  type: integer
  description: the type of logon which was performed
  sample_value: '2'
- standard_name: logon_process_name
  type: string
  description: 'The name of the trusted logon process that was used for the logon.
    See event "4611: A trusted logon process has been registered with the Local Security
    Authority" description for more information.'
  sample_value: User32
- standard_name: logon_authentication_package_name
  type: string
  description: 'The name of the authentication package which was used for the logon
    authentication process. Default packages loaded on LSA startup are located in
    "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig" registry key. Other packages
    can be loaded at runtime. When a new package is loaded a "4610: An authentication
    package has been loaded by the Local Security Authority" (typically for NTLM)
    or "4622: A security package has been loaded by the Local Security Authority"
    (typically for Kerberos) event is logged to indicate that a new package has been
    loaded along with the package name.'
  sample_value: Negotiate
- standard_name: user_logon_guid
  type: string
  description: 'a GUID that can help you correlate this event with another event that
    can contain the same Logon GUID, "4769(S, F): A Kerberos service ticket was requested
    event on a domain controller. It also can be used for correlation between a 4624
    event and several other events (on the same computer) that can contain the same
    Logon GUID, "4648(S): A logon was attempted using explicit credentials" and "4964(S):
    Special groups have been assigned to a new logon."'
  sample_value: '{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}'
- standard_name: logon_transmitted_services
  type: string
  description: the list of transmitted services. Transmitted services are populated
    if the logon was a result of a S4U (Service For User) logon process. S4U is a
    Microsoft extension to the Kerberos Protocol to allow an application service to
    obtain a Kerberos service ticket on behalf of a user - most commonly done by a
    front-end website to access an internal resource on behalf of a user.
  sample_value: '-'
- standard_name: logon_authentication_lan_package_name
  type: string
  description: 'The name of the LAN Manager sub-package (NTLM-family protocol name)
    that was used during logon. Possible values are: NTLM V1, NTLM V2, LM. Only populated
    if Authentication Package = NTLM.'
  sample_value: '-'
- standard_name: logon_key_length
  type: integer
  description: the length of NTLM Session Security key. Typically it has 128 bit or
    56 bit length. This parameter is always 0 if "Authentication Package" = "Kerberos",
    because it is not applicable for Kerberos protocol. This field will also have
    "0" value if Kerberos was negotiated using Negotiate authentication package.
  sample_value: '0'
- standard_name: logon_impersonation_level
  type: string
  description: Impersonation level
  sample_value: '%%1833'
- standard_name: logon_restricted_admin_mode
  type: string
  description: Only populated for RemoteInteractive logon type sessions. This is a
    Yes/No flag indicating if the credentials provided were passed using Restricted
    Admin mode. Restricted Admin mode was added in Win8.1/2012R2 but this flag was
    added to the event in Win10. If not a RemoteInteractive logon, then this will
    be "-" string.
  sample_value: '-'
- standard_name: logon_virtual_account
  type: string
  description: a "Yes" or "No" flag, which indicates if the account is a virtual account
    (e.g., "Managed Service Account"), which was introduced in Windows 7 and Windows
    Server 2008 R2 to provide the ability to identify the account that a given Service
    uses, instead of just using "NetworkService".
  sample_value: '%%1843'
- standard_name: user_linked_logon_id
  type: integer
  description: A hexadecimal value of the paired logon session. If there is no other
    logon session associated with this logon session, then the value is "0x0".
  sample_value: '0x0'
- standard_name: logon_elevated_token
  type: string
  description: a "Yes" or "No" flag. If "Yes" then the session this event represents
    is elevated and has administrator privileges.
  sample_value: '%%1842'
- standard_name: logon_user_claims
  type: string
  description: list of user claims for new logon session. This field contains user
    claims if user account was logged in and device claims if computer account was
    logged in
  sample_value: 'ad://ext/cn:88d2b96fdb2b4c49 <%%1818> : "dadmin" ad://ext/Department:88d16a8edaa8c66b
    <%%1818> : "IT"'
- standard_name: logon_device_claims
  type: string
  description: list of device claims for new logon session
  sample_value: '-'
- standard_name: target_user_logon_guid
  type: string
  description: 'a GUID that can help you correlate this event with another event that
    can contain the same Logon GUID, "4769(S, F): A Kerberos service ticket was requested
    event on a domain controller.'
  sample_value: '{0887F1E4-39EA-D53C-804F-31D568A06274}'
- standard_name: target_user_logon_id
  type: integer
  description: 'hexadecimal value that can help you correlate this event with recent
    events that might contain the same Logon ID, for example, "4624: An account was
    successfully logged on."'
  sample_value: '0x139faf'
