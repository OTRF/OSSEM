title: X509 and Certificates Schema
description: This document is a work in progress, but is a foundational start there
  is included. Specifically the main foundations of certificate information is already
  in here.
data_fields:
- standard_name: certificate_hash_md5
  type: string
  description: MD5 hash representation of the entire, computed, certificate. Also
    known as fingerprint or thumbprint
  sample_value: 6A255BEBF3DBCD13585538ED47DBAFD7
- standard_name: certificate_hash_sha1
  type: string
  description: SHA1 hash representation of the entire, computed, certificate. Also
    known as fingerprint or thumbprint
  sample_value: B0BF5AC2E81BBF597FAD5F349FEEB32CAC449FA2
- standard_name: certificate_hash_sha256
  type: string
  description: SHA256 hash representation of the entire, computed, certificate. Also
    known as fingerprint or thumbprint

- standard_name: certificate_issuer
  type: string
  description: Information about the CA that issued the certificate
  sample_value: CN=neu5ron.local,OU=Admin
- standard_name: certificate_subject
  type: string
  description: Information about the CA that issued the certificate
  sample_value: CN=natetoken,OU=Admin,DC=neu5ron,DC=local
- standard_name: certificate_serial_number
  type: string
  description: Serial number, this is chosen by the CA (certificate authority) which
    issued the certificate. Therefore this can relatively be arbritary if the CA does
    not follow a standard or is malicious.
