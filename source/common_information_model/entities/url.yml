title: URL Schema
description: 'Event fields used to define metadata about a URL/URI. There is a lot
  of ambiguity from the community on the difference URL vs URI. Granted, URL would
  normally include the domain, port (if applicable), user, password, query, fragment,
  and URI.

  However, there are many scenarios from log sources where one could not distinguish
  whether it was the full URL or just the URI.<br>

  URL data can be seen in various log sources as defined in http.md as well as other
  applications such as SIP. URLs, especially in HTTP, have a best practice implementation
  however it is not necessary to adhere for connections/data to be established.'
data_fields:
- standard_name: dst_host_name
  type: string
  description: Copied from the url_host_name
  sample_value: google.com
- standard_name: url_category
  type: string
  description: 'The defined grouping of a URL (or could be just based on the domain
    in the URL) related to what it is (ie: adult, news, advertising, parked domains,
    etc)'
  sample_value: Search Engines
- standard_name: url_extension
  type: string
  description: The extension (.dll, .php, zip, .msi, .txt, etc) without the "."
  sample_value: php
- standard_name: url_fragment
  type: string
  description: The portion of the URL after the last "#", this is defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.5.
    This is also referred to as the "hash" in some implementations. This value does
    not always exist
  sample_value: '``'
- standard_name: url_host_name
  type: string
  description: The domain/host/hostname of the URL. This could be an IP address or
    any variation of a value but is more than likely a domain/hostname
  sample_value: google.com
- standard_name: url_original
  type: string
  description: The entirety of the URL combined together and or the URL in the truest
    form from the log source. Some log sources will already parse out portions of
    the URL into their respective fields. Other logs will even parse out the portions
    of the URL into their respective field but also include the "original" URL. Always
    try to include this field, because HTTP/URLs never truly have to conform to any
    RFC/implementation and thus any parsing/logging implementation could have any
    number of assumptions/mistakes - therefore it is best to keep a original value
  sample_value: ftp://BigwheelPassword:BigwheelBobUser@google.com:8088/common/Current/client/search/greatsearch.php?hash=215696fc36392ca70f89228b98060afb%20processname=example.exe#gid=l1k4h
- standard_name: url_path
  type: string
  description: Everything beginning with and after the first "/". This portion should
    usually exist in the log source / URL.. Even if the path is just "/". Also, even
    if the url_query or url_fragment have not been parsed yet then you still include
    them in this value
  sample_value: '``'
- standard_name: url_port
  type: integer
  description: The port in the URL. This is not to be confused with destination.md.
    In your ETL pipeline you should check if the value derived from the URL is actually
    an integer (unless properly verified in the data source)... because as mentioned
    throughout, URLs can be manipulated/mis-implemented in many different ways
  sample_value: '8088'
- standard_name: url_query_names
  type: string
  description: 'The keys/fields derived from the url_query. Due to the limitless variations
    of implementations of a URL, providing a nested object of key/values is not recommened.
    Whether an attacker is injecting data into a URL or an incorrect implementaiton
    or malicious implementation - it''s possible you could have keys/fields of values
    of anything you can imagine (ie: "%*%)%*#Nf..$2f>hr..n fa.fa s\\\\\"\\jhrwq":
    "somevalue"'
  sample_value: '[ "hash" , "processname" ]'
- standard_name: url_query_values
  type: string
  description: 'The values derived from the url_query. Due to the limitless variations
    of implementations of a URL, providing a nested object of key/values is not recommened.
    Whether an attacker is injecting data into a URL or an incorrect implementaiton
    or malicious implementation - it''s possible you could have keys/fields of values
    of anything you can imagine (ie: "%*%)%*#Nf..$2f>hr..n fa.fa s\\\\\"\\jhrwq":
    "somevalue"'
  sample_value: '[ "215696fc36392ca70f89228b98060afb", "example.exe" ]'
- standard_name: url_scheme
  type: string
  description: 'Defines the network location (ie: smtp, ftp, smb, ldap, etc). This
    portion may not exist in many log sources. The is usually the value that comes
    before the first "://". This is also referred to as URN/origin'
  sample_value: ftp
- standard_name: url_user_name
  type: string
  description: The username defined in the URL. This is meant to be distinguished
    from something such as the value in the Authorization header in an HTTP request
    (or even the Proxy Authentication HTTP header). This value should be copied to
    any.md
  sample_value: BigwheelBobUser
- standard_name: url_user_password
  type: string
  description: The password defined in the URL. This is meant to be distinguished
    from something such as the value in the Authorization header in an HTTP request
    (or even the Proxy Authentication HTTP header)
  sample_value: BigwheelPassword
