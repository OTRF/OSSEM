title: DNS Schema
description: 'Event fields used to define metadata in DNS events. This commonly includes
  data in logs that contain DNS queries.

  Including, but not limited to, Zeek dns.log, Suricata DNS, Sysmon EventID 22, Windows
  DNS debug/trace logs.

  In the verbiage below, request is used to denote the client (or forwarded address
  if applicable) that is making the DNS request. This would commonly be the client/source
  that is looking up a domain.

  The response/answer, is used to denote the server that responded with the answer
  or responded to the request/client.

  It is important to remember that in DNS logs their are multiple servers that may
  be involved in the response. This is similar to how packets are forwarded through
  routers.'
