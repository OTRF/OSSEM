title: Network Schema
description: Event fields used to define metadata about network information seen in
  a typical OSI layer. This includes data both from an endpoint as well as a network
  monitoring device/application (NSM, Firewall, IPS, IDS, etc...). This differentiates
  from data that is specific to Source and Destination specific information such as
  Source or Destination bytes, packets, IP address, mac address, TCP flags.
data_fields:
- standard_name: fingerprint_network_community_id
  type: string
  description: Network community ID as outlined by the standard from https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec.
    Standardized hashing of network tuple. The combination, most commonly, of Source
    IP, Source Port, Destination IP, Destination Port, and IP Protocol allows pivoting
    between multiple log types
  sample_value: 1:EeVyZ07VGj1n0rld+xCLFdM+u8M=
- standard_name: network_application_name
  type: string
  description: Layer 7 (application) name specific to service/name/software as provided
    by a device or user
  sample_value: google-drive
- standard_name: network_application_protocol
  type: string
  description: 'Layer 7 (application) in the OSI model. Ex: HTTP,SMB,FTP,SSH, etc.
    This should be lowercased'
  sample_value: HTTP
- standard_name: network_bytes
  type: long
  description: Total bytes for the session. If this field does not exist in the log
    source, then its possible in your ETL pipeline to combine the source and destination
    bytes
  sample_value: '102034'
- standard_name: network_connection_history
  type: string
  description: TCP Flags and other potential IP header info
- standard_name: network_connection_history_detailed
  type: string
  description: Detailed description of the information in network_connection_history
- standard_name: network_connection_state
  type: string
  description: The end state of the session/connection as defined in short abbreviation
- standard_name: network_connection_state_detailed
  type: string
  description: Detailed description of the information in network_connection_state
- standard_name: network_direction
  type: string
  description: User/Device defined name of the direction of the connection
  sample_value: outbound
- standard_name: network_initiated
  type: boolean
  description: 'Whether the session was initiated or received. Most commonly used
    in relation to an endpoint/device. False = the endpoint did not initiate the session
    (ie: was scanned or RDP connection made to it)'
  sample_value: 'TRUE'
- standard_name: network_inner_vlan_id
  type: integer
  description: Normally the VLAN can not be determined as source/destination and VLANs
    are stacked/wrapped. This is the VLAN "inside"
  sample_value: '150'
- standard_name: network_ip_bytes
  type: long
  description: Total IP bytes, according to ip headers, for the session. If this field
    does not exist in the log source, then its possible in your ETL pipeline to combine
    the source and destination bytes
  sample_value: '14564'
- standard_name: network_missed_bytes
  type: long
  description: bytes that a network sensor or other system/application may have missed
  sample_value: '5'
- standard_name: network_outer_vlan_id
  type: integer
  description: Normally the VLAN can not be determined as source/destination and VLANs
    are stacked/wrapped. This is the VLAN on the "outside"
  sample_value: '160'
- standard_name: network_packets
  type: long
  description: Total packets for the session. If this field does not exist in the
    log source, then its possible in your ETL pipeline to combine the source and destination
    packets
  sample_value: '143'
- standard_name: network_protocol
  type: string
  description: 'Transport layer in the OSI model. Also known as, IP Protocol. Ex:
    TCP,UDP,ICMP,ICMP-v6, etc. Convert to lowercase'
  sample_value: tcp
