  description: "Records the state history of connections as a string of letters. If\

    \ \u2018q' flags are recorded a maximum of one time in either direction regardless\
    \ of how many are actually seen. \u2018f', \u2018h', \u2018r' and \u2018s' can\
    \ be recorded multiple times for either direction if the associated sequence number\
    \ differs from the last-seen packet of the same flag type. \u2018c', \u2018t'\
    \ and \u2018w' are recorded in a logarithmic fashion: the second instance represents\
    \ that the event was seen (at least) 10 times; the third instance, 100 times;\
    \ etc. The meaning of those letters are: # \"Letter\": \"Meaning\", \"s\": \"\
    a SYN w/o the ACK bit set\", \"h\": \"a SYN+ACK (\"handshake\")\", \"a\": \"a\

    \ (e.g. FIN+RST bits set)\", \"q\": \"multi-flag packet (SYN+FIN or SYN+RST bits\
