- standard_name: src_ip_addr
  standard_type: TBD
  name: client_addr
  type: ip
  description: IP address of the client. If a transaction is only a client sending
    INFORM messages then there is no lease information exchanged so this is helpful
    to know who sent the messages. Getting an address in this field does require that
    the client sources at least one DHCP message using a non-broadcast address.
  sample_value: 10.1.1.1
- standard_name: dst_ip_addr
  standard_type: TBD
  name: server_addr
  type: ip
  description: IP address of the server involved in actually handing out the lease.
    There could be other servers replying with OFFER messages which won't be represented
    here. Getting an address in this field also requires that the server handing out
    the lease also sources packets from a non-broadcast IP address
