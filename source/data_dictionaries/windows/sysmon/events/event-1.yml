title: 'Event ID 1: Process creation'
description: The **process creation** event provides extended information about a newly
  created process. The full command line provides context on the process execution.
  The ProcessGUID field is a unique value for this process across a domain to make
  event correlation easier. The hash is a full hash of the file with the algorithms
  in the HashType field.
