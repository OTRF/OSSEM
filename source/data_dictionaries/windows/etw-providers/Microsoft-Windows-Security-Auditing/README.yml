title: Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing ETW events
description: You can use Windows security and system logs to record and store collected
  security events so that you can track key system and network activities to monitor
  potentially harmful behaviors and to mitigate those risks. You customize system
  log events by configuring auditing based on categories of security events such as
  changes to user account and resource permissions, failed attempts for user logon,
  failed attempts to access resources, and attempts to modify system files.
