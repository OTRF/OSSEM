title: Detection Data Model
description: This part of the project focuses on defining the required data in form
  of data objects and the relationships among each other needed to facilitate the
  creation of data analytics and validate the detection of adversary techniques. This
  is inspired by the awesome work of MITRE with their project https://car.mitre.org/wiki/Main_Page.
  The information needed for each data object is pulled from the entities defined
  in the https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/OSSEM/blob/master/common_information_model.
