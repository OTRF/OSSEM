# Detection Data Model

## Description
This part of the project focuses on defining the required data in form of data objects and the relationships among each other needed to facilitate the creation of data analytics and validate the detection of adversary techniques. This is inspired by the awesome work of MITRE with their project https://car.mitre.org/wiki/Main_Page. The information needed for each data object is pulled from the entities defined in the https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/OSSEM/blob/master/common_information_model.
