# Data Dictionaries

This part of the OSSEM project contains specific information about several security event logs organized by operating system and their respective data sets. Each dictionary describes a single event log and its corresponding event field names. The difference between the [Common Information Model](https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/OSSEM/blob/master/common_information_model) folder and the data dictionaries is that in the CIM the field definitions are more general whereas in a data dictionary, each field name definition is unique to the specific event log.

## Data Dictionaries Definitions
